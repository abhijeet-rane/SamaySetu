> **Intellectual Property Notice — Patent Pending**
>
> The core scheduling algorithms, conflict-resolution engine, resource allocation logic, and database schema design of SamaySetu are protected under a pending patent application. The full production source code is maintained in a private repository.

## 🎯 Overview

**SamaySetu** (Sanskrit: "Bridge of Time") is a production-grade academic timetable management platform designed for universities and colleges. It replaces error-prone manual scheduling with an intelligent allocation framework that coordinates thousands of variables — faculty workloads, course types (Lecture vs. Lab), room capacities, student divisions, batch strengths, and teacher availability preferences — while enforcing **zero allocation conflicts** through an 8-point real-time validation engine.

### 🔗 Live Preview

> **[https://samaysetu.vercel.app](https://samaysetu.vercel.app)**
>
> The live deployment showcases the frontend interface. For preview purposes, backend API services are hosted on Azure App Service, while the target production infrastructure is designed for AWS.

## ⚡ Engineering Highlights

### 1. Dynamic Slot Type Alignment
**Problem:** Different academic divisions use different schedule tracks (TYPE_1, TYPE_2, etc.), but teachers and rooms are shared resources across divisions. A hardcoded slot filter breaks rendering for non-default configurations.

**Solution:** Implemented a dynamic slot detection algorithm that inspects fetched timetable entries at runtime, identifies the active time slot configuration, and selectively maps grid cells — ensuring consistency between the web UI and exported PDF/Excel documents.

### 2. Institutional-Grade PDF Compiler
**Problem:** Standard HTML-to-PDF libraries cannot produce the precise institutional document format required by universities — landscape layouts, vertical break-column text rendering, merged lab session cells, and signature sections.

**Solution:** Built a low-level PDF document compiler (209KB of generation logic) that constructs coordinate-based tables, manages character-level vertical text rendering, auto-fits division layouts, and embeds institutional headers with workload computation tables — matching the exact format of official institutional documents.

### 3. Lab Session Orchestration
**Problem:** Lab sessions span consecutive time slots across multiple batches, requiring atomic allocation of 3+ timetable entries that must all succeed or all fail, while respecting batch-level room and teacher constraints.

**Solution:** Designed a lab session group entity with a wizard-driven creation flow that atomically reserves consecutive slots, assigns batch-level room and teacher combinations, and validates all 8 conflict points for each sub-entry before committing the group.

### 4. Department-Scoped Multi-Tenancy
**Problem:** A university platform requires that HODs and department admins can only manage their own department's resources, while super admins have full cross-department access.

**Solution:** Implemented a department authorization service that intercepts every resource access (courses, divisions, rooms, teachers) and validates ownership against the authenticated user's department chain — enforced at the service layer, not just the UI.

### 5. Redis-Backed Performance Layer
**Problem:** Published timetables are read-heavy (viewed by hundreds of teachers and students) but write-infrequent (changed only during scheduling windows).

**Solution:** Implemented a cache-aside pattern using Redis for published timetables, with automatic cache eviction on publish/archive/entry-modification operations. Combined with tiered rate limiting (also Redis-backed) to protect against brute-force attacks.
